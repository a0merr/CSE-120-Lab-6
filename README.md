## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the code for **Lab 6** in CSE 120. The lab focuses on **object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts**, including classes, objects, and attributes in Python.  

The program allows the user to:  
1. Input **gene pairs** for two parent objects  
2. Create a **child object** with genes randomly selected from the parents  
3. Determine the **child’s eye color** based on inherited genes  

The goal of this lab was to practice:  
- Creating **classes and objects** in Python  
- Using **attributes and methods** to define behavior  
- Applying **random selection** for inheritance simulation  
- Handling **user input** and displaying results
